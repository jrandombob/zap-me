## Currently supported devices

This library currently only supports the Chinese Shock Collar often designated
with model number 880-3. Sometimes, it is also labeled as "1000M IP6X". It has a
characteristic remote with an antenna almost as long as the remote, an LED next
to it, supports 3 channels and 3 functions (shock, vibration, sound).
